# Database Setup Required

## Current Issue

The order management system is fully implemented but cannot be tested due to missing database configuration. The Prisma client is generating types based on a default schema rather than our custom schema because the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not configured.

## Error Details

- **TypeScript Errors**: Prisma client doesn't recognize `storeId`, `orderNumber`, and other custom fields
- **Root Cause**: Missing `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables
- **Impact**: Cannot sync Prisma schema with database, causing type mismatches

## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Set up MongoDB Database
```bash
# Option 1: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
# - Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
# - Create a cluster
# - Get connection string

# Option 2: Local MongoDB
# - Install MongoDB locally
# - Start MongoDB service
# - Use local connection string
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create or update `.env.local`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/alto-delivery?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

### 3. Sync Database Schema
```bash
# Push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Generate Prisma client with proper types
npx prisma generate

# Verify build passes
npm run build
```

## Current System Status

✅ **Completed Features:**
- Order management UI (New Orders, In-Progress, Completed)
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- React hooks for data management
- Error handling and loading states

⚠️ **Pending Database Configuration:**
- MongoDB connection
- Schema synchronization
- Type validation

## Testing After Setup

Once database is configured, test these workflows:
1. Create new orders via API
2. Update order status (new → accepted → preparing → for_delivery → completed)
3. View orders in dashboard
4. Filter and search completed orders

## Temporary Workaround

The code includes temporary type assertions to allow compilation, but these should be removed once the database is properly configured and Prisma client is regenerated.
